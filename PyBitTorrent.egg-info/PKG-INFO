Description: # PyBitTorrent
        ### A Python package for download torrent files.
        
        ## How to use:
        
        ~~~python
        from PyBitTorrent import TorrentClient
        
        client = TorrentClient('~/Downloads/Big Buck Bunny (1920x1080 h.264).torrent')
        client.start()
        ~~~
        
        That's it!
        The TorrentClient accepts the following parameters:
        
        ~~~python
            TorrentClient(
            torrent: str,
        max_peers: int,
        use_progress_bar: bool,
        peers_file: str,
        output_dir: str,
        )
        ~~~
        
        * torrent: path to a .torent file
        * max_peers: max peer should connect. after reaching this value, stop connecting to other peers. Big value will lead to
          more connected peers and therefore faster download speed, but this will make the handshake process be slower. The
          default should be good for mose uses (`12`)
        * use_progress_bar: should show the progress bar or the logger printing. The first option intended for better look in a
          terminal, but you should use the other one if you want detailed information about your download process. the default
          is `False`
        * peers_file: path to a text file contain list of peers should connect to. for example:
            ~~~text
            83.255.134.75:1
            68.235.36.213:1
            5.170.40.245:6881
            62.108.207.11:6881
            5.104.120.250:63356
            ~~~
          Default value is `None`
        * output_dir: Path to the directory the output files should be saved. default is `None`
        
        ## Simple usage:
        
        You can always use in the `Client.py` attached in the `exampled` folder
        
        ~~~bash
        python examples/Client.py --help
        
        usage: 
            Script for downloading torrent files
             [-h] --torrent TORRENT [--peers PEERS] [--output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [--use-progress-bar] [--max-peers MAX_PEERS]
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --torrent TORRENT     Path of the Torrent file
          --peers PEERS         Path to file contain peers (in the format ip:port for each line)
          --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                                Path to the output directory
          --use-progress-bar    should show progress bar
          --max-peers MAX_PEERS
                                Max connected peers
        ~~~
        
        ### Example of downloading torrent to "Downloads":
        
        ~~~bash
        python examples/Client.py --torrent "~/Downloads/Big Buck Bunny (1920x1080 h.264).torrent"--output-directory ~/Downloads

        ## The architecture of the program
        * At first, we are retrieving all available peers. we do it using the trackers from the `torrent` file, or from the `peers` file provided.
        * Then, we try to connect each one of them, until the value of `max_peers` achieved. The handshakes happen in a *poll* of threads. each thread contain `MAX_HANDSHAKE_THREADS` of peers to handshake with. the `number_of_polls` calculated according to the length of the given peers divided by the `MAX_HANDSHAKE_THREADS`, so we can cover all the peers. note that this process happens in <mark>parallel to the other 2 threads</mark>. continue to read for more details.
        * Right after lunching the handshakes thread polls, we start listening for incomming message using the `handle_messages` function, that calling the `receive_messages` in the `PeersManager` in his turn. This function will search for readable socket, and then parse the data to one of the `PyBitTorrent.Message` classes. This contains one of the two main threads of the program, that continue until completion of the download. 
        * Meanwhile we can start requesting for pieces. we do that by calling the function `piece_requester` in different threads. this function search after connected peer *(Unchoked connected peer)* that have the piece index we currently in. **The current strategy for piece picking is what we can call *Asynchronous chronological***. Means that we start requesting for piece index 0, 1, 2, until the end of the file, but not stuck the program if one of them is not full yet. **Better strategy can be implemented**, like *Rarest-Piece-First*, But i noticed that most of the torrent download process is in front of seeders, so i thought it will be useless right now. But of curs in communicating with actual peer (like in a new torrent file that just explode the internet), Smarter strategies can help.
        ### Charted flow of the program:

        ------
        ### Important notes:
        * **We are a dirty Leecher:** The current implementation is a _leecher_. That's mean you can only *Download* file, and not *upload* anything. You can conclude from that that other peers might see that in a bad eye and therefore give you a lower rate and bandwidth, and as a result you won't *unchoked* by them, resulting lower speed rate comparing to popular torrent clients. Keep in mind that the infrastructure for acting as peer/seeder has been laid, so implement it should be easy.
        * **statistic bug:** In the current architecture of the program, it is multi threaded. it seems that it cause some undefined bug in interacting with the `select` function in the `receive_messages` of the `PeersManager`. it mean stuck messages, that get released after the stuck peer will send any message. You sometime experience it when you see that all the peers are choked for few seconds/minutes, when in fact they are not.
